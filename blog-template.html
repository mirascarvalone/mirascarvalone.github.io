How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
  It was a little tricky because there were not a ton of elements we could add to our blog, since there isn't much there yet. We ended up using a tool called Mockingbird (whereas I had been drawing by myself on previous assignments), which I felt was a good tool.
Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
  Wireframe is definitely helpful to the development process because it gives you a skeleton to work with. I find in a lot of non-development tasks as well, it's helpful to draw out first what you're trying to do, which is basically what we were doing here.
What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
  We wanted our wireframe to be clear and easy to understand. The tool we used (Mockingbird) made it easy to move elements around the page, and while there wasn't a lot of content we felt we could add to the blog page, we tried to organize it well. We created a header at the top that was sort of a navigation pane, but we were not sure how to code that in HTML. Below that we included the blog title and some elements in the top header stating when the post was made and its topics covered, while the answers to the questions were in sections below.
What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
  We read through some of the areas in the "Sections and Outlines of an HTML5 Document" together and decided to add sections to our code. Sections are way of grouping content together - it's hard to see the usefullness of these at this ponit since we aren't really formatting anything, but I imagine it will be quite useful when we are formatting our websites and want certain parts of the page to behave differently.
