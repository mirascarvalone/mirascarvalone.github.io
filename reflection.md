#What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
  This was a good way to get some hands on practice using these properties to modify elements on my own website. I ended up using all three (padding, borders, and margin) in my headers and footers to create boxes that were in line but spaced out evenly.

#What did you learn about CSS positioning?
  I learned that it can be really frustrating and time consuming. I'm glad the challenge was time-boxed because I definitely spent a lot of time going down rabbit holes. In the future, I want to learn more about making my site more adaptable, so that it looks good on different sized screens and potentially other browsers/devices (right now it does not, and I'm aware of that).

#What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
  I spent a really long time trying to figure out how to make the picture and the "about me" box next to each other in a way that would make them the same height, and adjust automatically when the screen changed size. I could not figure out a way to change the size of that text box and image based on the screen resizing and still have them be the same height. So I manually set the size of those elements, and I'm aware that the page does not look great when the browser is small.

  It looks like there may be some way to work on this using the @media command to change text sizes when the screen gets smaller, but I didn't have enough time to fully research that since I was timeboxing.

  I felt it was easy to structure my page because of our previous knowledge of HTML best practices and adding sections to our code. It was good to get practice using classes since they are so useful. I also learned that even though the codeacademy lessons made sense to me, it's still more difficult to actually implement them in situations that seem quite simple (such as making a text box and image go on the same line and format properly).

#What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
  I find working with CSS very frustrating because it appears to be a lot of trial and error, and I did find it really time consuming. This challenge did make me more comfortable googling questions that I had and using stack overflow, but I'm still finding it really hard to make a website that looks remotely decent by modern standards. I did find the dev tools useful as a quick way to make a small modification to your CSS and immediately see if it did what you wanted.
