  <h1>Week 1 Learnings</h1>
  <h2>Version Control and Git/GitHub/h2>
  <h4>October 25, 2015</h4>

      This week I learned a lot more about the command line, and how to use Git and GitHub to manage my workflow and collaborate with others. There was a lot of emphasis on version control and why we would need to be mindful of version control while we were coding. I have used Git and GitHub before in my previous role as a data analyst, so I had some familiarity with these concepts. We use version control so that we can capture snapshots of our work at different times, in case we may need to go back and edit our previous work. This also allows us to collaborate better with others since we can locate exactly when we made certain changes and see how that interacts with other’s work. We also allow others to comment on our changes and make sure they are correct before we finalize them.

      Git helps us track our changes in several ways. We can create branches that track a set of changes we are trying to make to accomplish a certain task, and group those together. We can create “commits,” which are a snapshot of our files and changes at a certain point in time. Further, we have a detailed record of exact dates when certain changes were made using git.
    </p>

      Git is a local version control system that lives on your computer whereas Github is a remote entity where people share their code so developers can see and edit each other’s work. Because GitHub allows developers to share and edit each other’s code, it is a useful place to store your code.
