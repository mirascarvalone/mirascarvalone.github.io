    <p>Week 6: Ruby - Objects and Classes</p>

    <p>
      This week we learned about objects and classes in Ruby and how to use them to model some basic games. Here I'll present a very basic tic tac toe game.
    </p>

    <h1>Basic Code
    </h1>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
      class TicTac
        def initialize(board)
          @board = board
        end

        def play
          p "enter a row"
            @row = gets.chomp.to_i
          p "enter a column"
            @column = gets.chomp.to_i
          p "enter X or O"
            @move = gets.chomp
          @board[@row][@column] = @move

          @board.each do |row|
            p row
          end
        end

      end


      board = [["","",""],
              ["","",""],
              ["","",""]]

      game = TicTac.new(board)
      game.play
      game.play
    </pre>

    <h1>Classes
    </h1>

    <p>What I've done above is create a class called TicTac - this allows me to model a set of behaviors (methods) that I define inside that class. Here I have the initialize method, which creates a new instance of the TicTac class, and the play method, which allows me to play a turn of TicTacToe by soliciting input from the user about which row and column to place an X or O in. Then I print out the board to the screen to reflect the moves.
    </p>

    <h1>Instance Variables
    </h1>

    <p>You may notice the @ sign before many of my variable names. This creates an instance variable which allows us to access a variable from outside the method where it was created. This ensures that we have the same board from the initialize method as the play method.
