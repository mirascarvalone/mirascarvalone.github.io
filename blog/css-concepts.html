    <p>Week 3: Intro to CSS - Margins, Borders, and Padding</p>
    <p>November 6, 2015</p>
  </section>

      This week we learned how to use CSS to format our websites. In CSS, the concept of the "box model" is important to understand how we can position and format elements. A diagram of the box model is below:
    </p>

    <img id = "box_model" src="../imgs/box_model.png">

    <p>
      Going from the inside out, the content box refers to any type of content, including tables, pictures, blocks of text, blog posts, etc. The next level is padding, which refers to the space between the content and border. The next level is the border, which we can think of traditionally as how we would view a border around a text box. The last is the margin, which separates the element from other content on the page.
    </p>
    <p>
      An important thing to keep in mind is that when we set the height or width of an object, that refers to the content portion, and we set the border, margin, and padding length separately. Here's an example involving a box of text:
    </p>

    <img id = "box_example" src="../imgs/box_example.png">

    <p>
      Here, the border, margin, and padding have all been set to 30px, and the border has been formatted red. We can see that the padding is the space between the text and the beginning of the red border, and the margin is the space from the edge of the red border and the edge of the page.
