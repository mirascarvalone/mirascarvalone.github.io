    <p>Week 7: JavaScript Introduction</p>
    <p>December 1, 2015</p>
  </section>

    <p>
      This week was the beginning of our JavaScript curriculum. There are a lot of similarities to Ruby and the types of tasks we've learned to program in the past few weeks, but the syntax is different, and there are a few other key differences. I'll elaborate on one of them below.
    </p>

    <h1>Looping in Ruby vs. JavaScript
    </h1>

    <p>Let's say we have an array of numbers from 1 to 10. In Ruby, there are a few ways we could iterate through them and print each out:
    </p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-ruby">
      my_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
      my_numbers.each do |x|
        puts x
      end

      for i in 0..my_numbers.length-1
        puts my_numbers[i]
      end
    </pre>

    <p>Whether we are using the built-in .each method or manually iterating through each position of the array, we are essentially performing the same task: telling an iterator where to start and end, how much to increment, and what to do at each stage. The concept is similar in JavaScript, although the syntax is different.
    </p>

    <pre class="prettyprint lang-javascript">
      my_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]

      for (var i=0; i < my_numbers.length; i +=1)
        console.log(my_numbers[i])
    </pre>

    <p>Note that in JavaScript we do not require an "end" after our for loop, and we use console.log to print to the screen. Within the for parenthesis, we are setting a variable i that starts at 0 and increments by 1 until it reaches the length of the array - then we print out the array at each position.
    </p>
